	<p>During the 2022-23 school year I grew a lot outside of school, I turned my main sport from Basketball to Golf and started working out as well. You can see me at the League Tournament on the left where I ended qualifying for the Regional Championchips for Northern California. You can also see me working out on the right (this was the last rep of that set, I swear I dont suffer that much on just that much weight.)</p>
